All other rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall expire upon termination of this Agreement, except that all payment obligations accrued hereunder prior to termination or expiration shall survive such termination.

11. CONFIDENTIALITY
11.1 Nondisclosure. Each Party (each a "Receiving Party") agrees that it shall use and reproduce the Confidential Information of the other Party (the "Disclosing Party") only for purposes of exercising its rights and performing its obligations under this Agreement and only to the extent necessary for such purposes; shall restrict disclosure of such Confidential Information to the Receiving Party's employees, consultants, or advisors who have a need to know; and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party. The foregoing obligations shall be satisfied by the Receiving Party through the exercise of at least the same degree of care used to restrict disclosure and use of its own information of like importance, but not less than reasonable care. All third parties to whom the Receiving Party discloses Confidential Information must be bound in writing by obligations of confidentiality and non-use at least as protective of such information as this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be a breach of this Agreement for the Receiving Party to disclose Confidential Information if compelled to do so under law, in a judicial or other governmental investigation or proceeding, provided that, to the extent permitted by law, the Receiving Party has given the Disclosing Party prior notice and reasonable assistance to permit the Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to object to and/or limit the judicial or governmental requirement to disclosure.

11.2 Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Party shall be liable for using or disclosing information that such Party can prove: (i) was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed or has entered the public domain through no fault of the Receiving Party; (ii) was known to the Receiving Party, without restriction, at the time of disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the time of disclosure; (iii) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party; (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of the Confidential Information, as demonstrated by files created at the time of such independent development; (v) becomes known to the Receiving Party, without restriction, from a source other than the Disclosing Party without breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party and otherwise not in violation of the Disclosing Party's rights; or (vi) is disclosed generally to third parties by the Disclosing Party without restrictions similar to those contained in this Agreement.

11.3 Remedies. The Receiving Party agrees that a breach of this Section 11 may result in immediate and irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party that money damages alone may be inadequate to compensate. Therefore, in the event of such a breach, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including but not limited to a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction or permanent injunction without the posting of a bond or other security.

12. LIMITATION ON DAMAGES
12.1 EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. EXCEPT FOR BREACH OF SECTION 5 OR SECTION 11 AND INDEMNIFICATION FOR THIRD-PARTY DAMAGES ARISING UNDER SECTION 13 OF THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY SOUNDS IN CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE, Regardless of Cause.

13.2 The indemnified Party shall promptly notify the indemnifying Party in writing of any Claim; provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent of any material prejudice directly resulting from such failure.

13.3 In the event any portion of Palladium WMS is held or believed by Con-Struct, or any portion of the User Data is held or believed by the User, to infringe or misappropriate Intellectual Property Rights of any third party (such portion to be deemed the "Infringing Materials") in any place where Palladium WMS is used or accessed, then in addition to any other rights in this Section 13, Con-Struct (where the Infringing Materials are Palladium WMS) or User (where the Infringing Materials are the User Data) shall, at its sole expense and at its option: (i) obtain from such third party the right for the other party to continue to use the Infringing Materials; or (ii) modify the Infringing Materials to avoid and eliminate such infringement or misappropriation, as the case may be; or (iii) upon mutual agreement with the other party, remove and disable the Infringing Materials; or (iv) if none of the foregoing remedies is commercially feasible, terminate this Agreement, Regardless of Cause.
